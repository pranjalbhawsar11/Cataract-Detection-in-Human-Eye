# Cataract-Detection-in-Human-Eye
A cataract is the most common disease that might cause blindness. In this project, We aim to develop a system based on classical machine learning algorithms and deep CNNs for the identification of cataracts in the human eye as a classification task.

# Introduction
Fundus image is a significant reference for the diagnosis of cataract disease. The classification of fundus images mainly consists of three parts: preprocessing of fundus images, feature extraction, and classification. 
Fundus Images:
Fundus images are specialized medical images that capture the retina, optic disc, and other structures at the back of the eye. They help ophthalmologists diagnose various eye conditions
Feature Extraction:
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
Sobel operator
VGG19
